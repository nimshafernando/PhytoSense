# PhytoSense üåø  
**Explainable AI-Driven Workflow for Predicting Phytochemicals to Inhibit EGFR in Oral Cancer**

---

## üìå Project Overview
PhytoSense is my Final Year Project prototype that integrates **computer vision, cheminformatics, and explainable AI** to accelerate drug discovery for oral cancer.  

The system classifies medicinal plant species from leaf images, retrieves their associated phytochemicals, visualizes molecular structures, and sets the foundation for QSAR-based prediction of EGFR inhibition potential.  

This is the **midpoint prototype**, demonstrating:
- Medicinal leaf classification (ensemble deep learning)  
- Phytochemical retrieval from mapped sources  
- 2D/3D molecular visualization via RDKit and py3Dmol  
- Flask web-based prototype with image upload support  

Final implementation will expand to include **QSAR modeling** and **explainability integration**.
